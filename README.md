# bert-topic-papers-analysis
This project applies **BERTopic**, a topic modeling technique based on BERT, to analyze the titles and abstracts of scientific papers published between 2004 and 2024.
The goal is to extract the main recurring topics and identify **semantic trends over time**.

The workflow includes:
- Downloading and organizing the documents by year
- Preprocessing the text
- Training a BERTopic model on both titles and abstracts
- Trend analysis across the 20-year timespan
- Model validation using semantic coherence metrics

The core implementation is provided in the notebook **bert_python.ipynb** available on Google Colaboratory.

# Project objectives
- Extract the dominant topics from scientific paper titles and abstracts
- Analyze how these topics evolve from 2004 to 2024
- Identify the most representative keywords for each year
- Measure topic quality using coherence metrics
- Highlight major changes in technical and engineering-related terminology over time
